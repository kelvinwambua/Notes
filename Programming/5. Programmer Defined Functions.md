<h2>Modular Programming</h2>
This is the process of subdividing a large programming task into subtasks called modules each dealing with a specific function to be performed by the program

<h4>Top - Down approach</h4>
This consists of a hierarchical  structuring model where superior models are designed first before designing subordinate modules  ensuring decisions made at a higher level are not ignored

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>
#define PI 3.14 //Global Variable 
double area(double r); 
circumference(double r);//Fuction Prototype
int main() { 
	double radius, A, C; //Local Variables 
	printf("Enter the radius of a circle: ");
	scanf("%lf", &radius); 
	A = area(radius); // Fuction Prototype
	C = circumference(radius); 
	printf("\nThe area of a circle is: %.2lf\n", A); 
	printf("\nThe circumference of a circle is: %.2lf\n", C);
	return 0; 
} 
//Next are Function Definitions of area and circumference double area(double r) //A Function Header { return PI * pow(r, 2)

```

<h3>Functions</h3>
These are subprograms that make up a program. It is a self-contained code that performs specific tasks by using programmer defined functions as follows:

- Procedural Abstraction
- Reuse of function subprograms
- Length of source program can be reduced by using a series of functions which can reduce the memory overhead

A function call or function invocation is an expression consisting of a function name followed by arguments enclosed in parenthesis. If there are more than one argument, then they are separated by commas.

<h2> Programmer Defined Functions </h2>
It consists of two parts:
- Function prototype/ function declaration
- The function definition

```C
double convert();// Function prototype/declaration

// Function definition
double convert(){
	int price;
	printf("%d", price*132.2);
	
}

```

```C
double convert(double) = double convert(double price);

// Note that this only applies to function prototypes, Function definitions must have the double price

```

<h3> Call by value and Call by reference parameters</h3>

- Call by Value
	Let us start with an example

```C
#include <stdio.h>

void modifyValue(int x) {
    x = x * 2; // Modify the local copy of x
    printf("Inside modifyValue: x = %d\n", x);
}

int main() {
    int num = 10;
    printf("Before modifyValue: num = %d\n", num);

    modifyValue(num); // Pass the value of num

    printf("After modifyValue: num = %d\n", num); // num remains unchanged
    return 0;
}

```

```Terminal

Before modifyValue: num = 10 
Inside modifyValue: x = 20 
After modifyValue: num = 10
```

- In the `main` function, `num` is initialized to 10.
- `modifyValue(num)` is called, passing the _value_ of `num` (which is 10) to the function.
- Inside `modifyValue`, the parameter `x` receives a copy of this value.
- The value of `x` is doubled (20), but this change only affects the local copy within the function.
- After the function call, the original `num` in `main` remains unchanged (10).


- Call by Reference

```C
#include <stdio.h>

void modifyReference(int *ptr) {
    *ptr = *ptr * 2; // Modify the value at the memory location pointed to by ptr
    printf("Inside modifyReference: *ptr = %d\n", *ptr);
}

int main() {
    int num = 10;
    printf("Before modifyReference: num = %d\n", num);

    modifyReference(&num); // Pass the memory address of num

    printf("After modifyReference: num = %d\n", num); // num is now modified
    return 0;
}

```

```Terminal
Before modifyReference: num = 10
Inside modifyReference: *ptr = 20 
After modifyReference: num = 20
```

- In `main`, `num` is initialized to 10.
- `modifyReference(&num)` is called, passing the _memory address_ of `num` to the function.
- Inside `modifyReference`, the parameter `ptr` receives this memory address.
- `*ptr` is used to access and modify the value at that memory location, doubling it to 20.
- After the function call, the original `num` in `main` is now also 20 because the function directly modified the value at its memory address.

<h3> Categories of Functions </h3>

1. Function with argument has a return value 
2. Void functions; this is a function that returns no value.

<h3> Argument List Correspondence </h3>

The number of actual argument used in a call to a function must be the same as the number of formal parameters used in the function prototype. 
The order of arguments in the lists determined a correspondence. The first actual argument corresponds to the first formal parameter and so on. 
Each argument must be of a data type that can be assigned to the corresponding formal parameter with no unexpected loss of information.
